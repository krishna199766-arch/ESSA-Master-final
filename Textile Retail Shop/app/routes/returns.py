"""Customer returns — goods coming back against the bill they went out on.

A return is not a sale in reverse; it is its own document (a credit note) that
undoes part of one invoice. Undoing it properly means touching everything the
sale touched:

  stock     the goods come back. Resellable ones go on the shelf; damaged ones
            come back and are immediately written off, so the movement log shows
            what really happened rather than a shelf count that quietly lies.
  GST       the tax on the returned lines is reversed, split the same way the
            invoice split it (IGST interstate, CGST/SGST otherwise).
  discount  a bill-level discount is refunded pro rata, or a customer returning
            one item of five would get back more than they paid for it.
  loyalty   points earned on the refunded amount are taken back, and what the
            customer actually spent comes down.
  commission the staff member on the ORIGINAL sale loses the credit — not
            whoever happens to be handling the return. See routes/staff.py.
  promotion a free item was earned by buying something. Hand that something
            back and it is not earned any more, so the promotions on the bill
            are re-checked and what the customer no longer qualifies for is
            either returned with it, charged for, or written off — whichever the
            scheme says. See app/promotions.review_return.

Nothing can come back twice: every line is capped at what it was sold for, less
what has already been credited.
