"""Delivery — handing the goods over, against the bill they were paid on.

Billing and collection are two desks. The till took the money and took the stock
off the shelf; nothing until now recorded whether the customer actually left with
the garments. That gap is where a shop loses pieces and where "I paid for three
and got two" has no answer either way.

So this module moves NO stock and NO money — the sale did both, and a delivery
that adjusted either would be undoing a sale that plainly happened. What it
records is custody, the way `alterations.py` does: which bills, which pieces,
verified against the tag on each garment, handed over by a named person.

Three things about the shape are deliberate.

**One delivery, several bills.** A customer billed at two counters leaves with
one bundle, and the handover is the bundle. `DeliveryBill` is what makes the
left-hand list on the screen a list. The reference ERP scans a *settlement
number* here; this shop has no settlement document, and minting an empty one to
hold a number would be a record that never says anything. The delivery IS the
settlement.

**Part collection is a first-class answer, not a failure.** Two of five going
home while three wait for an alteration is the ordinary Saturday, so a delivery
saves what actually went out and the bill stays open for the balance. Anything
else forces the counter to choose between a lie and no record at all.

**A scan is the verification, and an override is visible.** Ordinary staff must
read a tag for every piece. A manager may pass one by hand — a label torn off in
a bag is real — and that costs a reason, their name and a line on the delivery
note. An override anyone could give is a scan that has quietly become optional,
and the verified count then means nothing.

    `warehouse_items.resolve_scan` is the shop's one scan entry point and this

    The till pulls an unknown item in because a tag that exists must be sellable;
    a delivery desk is only ever verifying goods that are already on a bill in
    front of it, so a code the shop has never seen cannot be on that bill, and
    importing it would add a catalogue row for a mis-scan.

    That leaves one gap this closes. A bare per-piece code — `ESSA-00002-007`
    off an individual garment — is not a SKU, not a barcode and not a QR
    payload, so the shop's own tables do not hold it; `resolve_scan` finds it
    only by querying the warehouse's `product_units`, which is exactly what
    switching imports off gives up. Since a piece code IS its SKU with a
    sequence appended, the SKU is recoverable from the code itself, and the
    delivery desk then reads piece tags with no warehouse attached at all —

    item, so reading it three times for a line of three is three garments and
    entirely correct. A per-piece tag (`EU1|…`, or a bare `ESSA-00002-007`) names
    one physical garment, so reading it twice is the same garment passing the
