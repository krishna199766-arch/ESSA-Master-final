"""Adding a column to a database that predates it.

The shop carries no migration tool, and adopting one for the handful of columns
that postdate the original schema would be heavier than the problem. A
single-column ALTER is cheap and standard, so each module that introduces a
column asks for it here at startup and moves on.

Postgres is included, and it did not use to be. The reasoning then was that on
another engine "the schema is someone else's job" — true when the shop's only
Postgres would have been somebody else's server. It is not true now: mounted
inside the warehouse the shop creates and owns its own schema (see
backend/app/pos_mount), and `create_all` builds only missing TABLES. A column
added to a model after that schema exists is simply absent, and the first query
that mentions it fails — which is exactly the class of fault this file exists to
prevent. The warehouse solves the same problem the same way, in
main._add_missing_columns.
