"""The shop's reports, as data rather than as pages.

Each report knows what it counts and returns the same shape —
{columns, rows, totals, note} — so one renderer draws all of them and a question
asked in English or Tamil can be answered by picking one and filling in its
dates. `note` is where a report says the thing that would otherwise be assumed
wrong: that returns are netted off the seller, that stock value is at cost, that
a walk-in has no customer to name.

Adding a report here makes it answerable by the ask bar automatically — the
router's list of keys is built from REPORTS, so the two cannot drift apart.
