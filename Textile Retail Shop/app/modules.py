"""The shop's modules, in one list.

The dashboard's cards and the header's menu are the same thing shown two ways —
a grid when you arrive, a dropdown once you are working — so they are built from
this rather than each carrying its own copy. Adding a screen here puts it in
both, and neither can quietly fall behind the other.

`owns` is how a screen knows which module it belongs to. Endpoints do not map to
modules one-for-one: the `pos` blueprint holds both the billing counter and the
invoice register, and an invoice being viewed or printed is still Invoices. So a
module claims endpoint prefixes rather than a blueprint.
