    That is what lets a label be stuck on a garment rather than on a shelf edge. A
    scan of any child code resolves to the product (so every existing scan point
    keeps working), while the code itself says which of the eight it is — which is
    what a returns desk, a lost-piece query or a per-piece audit needs and a shared
    SKU code can never answer.

    Deliberately NOT stock rows: eight units under a stock of eight is the same
    eight garments, not sixteen. `status` tracks where a piece is; the quantity
    remains the ledger's answer.

    """What the invoice billed and the cartons did not deliver.

    A supplier bills 50 pieces; 40 come out of the boxes. Until now the receiving
    screen had only two answers, and both were lies: invent ten pieces so the
    breakdown balances (stock gains units that do not exist), or leave the GRN
    unpostable forever. This is the third and true answer — *ten were short* — and
    it is recorded here, on the floor, at the moment the boxes are opened, by the
    only person who can know it.

    That timing is the whole point, and it is why this belongs to the Receive flow
    and not to Inventory. Once a GRN posts, the difference has already been
    absorbed: the stock figure is 40, the invoice says 50, and nothing on the
    system remembers why. Recorded *before* posting, the gap is a document — with
    a quantity, a reason and a name against it — that the debit note is later
    built from without anyone re-counting anything.

    `kind` says what happened to the units, and the only thing that separates the
    three is which side of the count they land on:

      * **short** — never arrived. Never becomes stock.
      * **damaged** — arrived, but rejected at the dock and set aside for the
        supplier. Also never becomes stock: taking it in and writing it off again
        would put goods we refused into the valuation for as long as the paperwork
        takes. Damage found *later*, in stock we already accepted, is a purchase
        return — that is the existing module, and it reverses stock because there
        is stock to reverse.
      * **excess** — more arrived than was billed. The mirror case, and it *does*
        become stock: the goods are on the floor whatever the invoice says.

    So `PurchaseLine.received_qty` = billed − short − damaged + excess, and it is
    that figure the attribute breakdown has to add up to and that posting turns
    into stock. The invoice line is left alone, exactly as it is for a breakdown:
    it stays the record of what the supplier billed, so the payables side keeps
    reconciling against their own document.

    Money is deliberately absent from this table. A shortage is a *fact about a
    count*; what it is worth is a fact about the GRN, derived from the line rate
    whenever it is asked for (services/shortages.unit_cost). Freezing a rate here
    would be a second place for the same number to live, and the debit note —
    which is where it becomes financial — re-derives from the GRN anyway.

    `waived` is the one decision a human makes afterwards: the supplier is sending
    the rest, or it is not worth the paperwork. A waived shortage stays on the
    record and stops being offered for claim; a claimed one is answered by the
    posted debit note that references it."""

    someone sets a category on a GRN line by hand, that correction is kept and the
    same wording maps itself next time — the engine gets better with use instead of
    waiting on a developer to add another synonym.

    The key is the CANONICAL form of the description (gender words replaced by the

    correction covers every spelling that canonicalises the same way: teach it
    "Ladies Tee" and "Women's Tee" is taught too.

    piece — and a dozen of each is a different number of things to put a QR on.
    One table answers both halves of that, because they are the same question
    asked twice:

      * **the billed unit** — DOZ on the invoice means `pieces` = 12,

    `aliases` is what makes it survive real invoices, where the same unit is

    data is laid out on a 50×35mm sticker is a decision made once by a manager
    and then used by the warehouse for months. Storing a product's name IN a
    template would mean a template per product; storing the *reference*
    ("product_name goes at 4mm/9mm, 8pt, bold") means one template prints the
    whole warehouse, and a product renamed on its GRN prints correctly the next
    day without anyone reopening the designer.

    `elements` is the design: a list of

        {"id": "e3", "field": "size", "x": 4, "y": 18, "w": 22, "h": 5,
         "size": 8, "bold": true, "align": "left", "prefix": "Size: ",
         "locked": false, "visible": true, "z": 3}

    with x/y/w/h in MILLIMETRES from the label's top-left corner, because that is
    what the printer works in and what the person holding a ruler against the
    output can check. Field keys are the catalogue in services/label_designer.py;
    an element naming a field that catalogue no longer has renders as blank
    rather than breaking the sheet, so a template outlives a renamed attribute.

    `locked` is per element and is enforced in the UI only — it stops a warehouse
    user nudging the QR off the sticker by accident, which is a usability guard,
    not a permission. Deleting or moving a locked element is still possible after
    unlocking it, which is the point.

    One template at a time may be `is_default`; that is the one the printing
