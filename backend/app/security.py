"""
Who is allowed to call what.

The rule is one table, not a decorator on each of the ~130 routes. A decorator
per route is the usual shape, but here it would mean touching twenty router
files and, worse, it would mean that the answer to "what can a floor user
actually do?" is only obtainable by reading all twenty. POLICY below is that
answer, on one screen, and a route added tomorrow inherits the rule for its
prefix instead of being silently unprotected because someone forgot the
decorator.

The split, per module:

    user        LR, invoice entry, GRN, inventory, bundles, outward/inward,
                label printing, notifications, voice, dashboard
    admin       the above plus masters, suppliers, label design, reports,
                payments, returns, dead stock, asking questions, the audit trail
    superadmin  the above plus accounts, server settings and the Command Center
    superboss   everything a super admin has — the difference is in who may
                manage whom (services/users.may_manage), not in a path here

Reads and writes are ranked separately because the two do not follow each
other. Masters are an admin screen, but the floor cannot record a receipt
without reading the category and unit lists behind it — so masters read at
`user` and write at `admin`. Payments are admin at both ends: nothing on the
floor asks what a supplier is owed.
