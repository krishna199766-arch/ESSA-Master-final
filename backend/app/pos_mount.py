"""The retail shop (POS) module, served from inside this API at /pos.

The shop — "Textile Retail Shop" beside this backend — is a finished Flask app
with its own database, its own login and its own screens. It is not rewritten
into React here. It is mounted, as WSGI, under this same server, and the POS
button in the warehouse UI opens it in a frame.

Mounting rather than running it beside us on a second port is what makes the
button work at all: a Flask session cookie set by http://localhost:8100 is a
third-party cookie inside a frame served from :8000, and browsers drop it — the
POS would ask for a login it could never accept. Same origin, one port, one
process; the cookie is first-party and the whole thing behaves like a page of
this app.

The one wrinkle is that both codebases call their package `app`. Python has
room for exactly one `app` in sys.modules, and ours is already there. So the
shop is imported with ours lifted out of the way and put back afterwards (see
_load below) — which works because every `from app…` in the shop runs while its
package is the one installed. Two of them used to run later, at request time,
long after ours was back; those two imports were hoisted to the top of their
files (app/utils.py, app/routes/pos.py) so nothing reaches for `app` once the
swap is over.

    The two codebases were written against separate SQLite FILES, and five of
    their table names are the same: categories, floors, products,
    stock_movements and users. A file each made that harmless. One Postgres
    database does not —
    whichever app runs `create_all` first wins the name, and the other then
    queries a table with its own name and the wrong columns. The symptom is a
    column that "does not exist" on a table that plainly does.

    `users` is the one that matters most: the shop's logins and the warehouse's
    accounts are different tables with the same name, and merging them would be
    a security problem rather than an error message.

    A Postgres schema per app is the standard separation. What matters is HOW the
    shop is told about it, and the first attempt got that wrong: it appended
    `options=-csearch_path=shop` to the connection URL, which puts the schema in
    the SESSION. That works on a direct connection and is silently dropped by a
    transaction-mode pooler — which is what the deployment connects through
    (Supabase's pooler, port 6543). The option went nowhere, every unqualified
    name resolved in `public`, and the shop read the warehouse's `categories`.

    So the schema is named on the shop's METADATA instead, through
    SHOP_DB_SCHEMA — it lands in the statement (`FROM shop.categories`) and needs
    nothing from the connection, which is what makes it survive any pooler. See
    the shop's app/__init__.

    On SQLite this does nothing at all, because two files were never the problem.
