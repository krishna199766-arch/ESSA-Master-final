"""
Accounts, passwords and sign-in tokens.

Four ranked roles. Everything the app gates on is a comparison against this
rank, never a string equality test, so adding a tier later is one line here
rather than a hunt through the routers:

    user        the floor — receive, count, scan, print, dispatch
    admin       the floor plus the setup it works against, and the money screens
    superadmin  all of it, plus this table and the server's own settings
    superboss   all of it, plus the one thing a super admin cannot do: manage a
                Super Boss. The owner's seat — see `may_manage` below.

Passwords are stored as PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a per-user salt, using only the
standard library — the deployment is a laptop or a small server and adding a
bcrypt build step to it buys nothing here. Tokens are HMACs rather than rows in
a session table: the phone is offline half the day and a stateless token
survives a server restart, which a session row would not. Revocation still
works because the user's `token_seed` is inside the signature — change the seed
and every token already issued stops verifying.
