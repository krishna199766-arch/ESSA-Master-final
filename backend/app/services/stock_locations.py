"""Where the stock is — the ledger split by warehouse.

WHAT THIS CHANGES. Until now `Product.stock_qty` was one number for the whole
company and `StockMovement` had no idea which building it happened in. That was
the honest shape of a one-warehouse business, and it is the single thing standing
between this app and a second warehouse: with one figure, receiving in Erode and
dispatching from Karur both move the same pile, and "how much is in Karur" has no
answer to give.

So every movement now names a warehouse, and the balance at each one is kept in
`stock_balances`.

THE COMPANY TOTALS STAY WHERE THEY WERE. `Product.stock_qty` and
`Product.avg_cost` are still maintained, as the roll-up of the balances beneath
them. That is deliberate and it is what makes this change safe to land: a dozen
screens, the locator, dead stock, the reports and the shop sync all read those
two columns, and they keep reading the same numbers they always did. Nothing had
to be rewritten to keep working; things get rewritten to become warehouse-aware,
one at a time, because they want to be.

THE LEDGER IS STILL THE TRUTH. `stock_balances` is a cache of a sum — kept
because the picker's screen asks "what is on hand here" before every dispatch
line, and answering that with a GROUP BY over every movement ever written is a
table scan per keystroke. Every write goes through `apply` below, which appends
the movement and updates the balance together; `rebuild` recomputes the table
from the ledger whenever the two are doubted, and `backfill` is that same replay
run once over a database that predates any of this.

WHY AVERAGE COST IS PER WAREHOUSE. The same shirt bought at ₹180 into Erode and
₹200 into Karur is worth different money in each building. A warehouse-wise stock
valuation built on one blended figure would report, for both, a value neither of
them holds. So the weighted average rolls per warehouse, and the company figure
is the value-weighted roll-up of them — which, with one warehouse, is the number
this app has always shown.

STORES ARE NOT IN HERE. A store's stock lives in the till's own database, which
reads the dispatches raised against it (see pos_mount and the shop's
app/transfers). Stock dispatched to a shop therefore LEAVES this ledger and does
not arrive anywhere in it. Recording an arrival here as well would put the same
garment on two systems' shelves and double the company's stock on hand.
