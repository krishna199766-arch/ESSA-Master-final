"""
Aggregated series for the graphical dashboard.

Every series here is a *shape of data*, not a picture: `{labels, values}` or a
list of `{label, value}`. The screen decides what to draw. That split matters
because the same numbers appear on the static dashboard as tiles, and if the two
disagree the dashboard has told someone two different things about one warehouse.

WHY THIS AGGREGATES SERVER-SIDE
-------------------------------
The alternative is to run the reports and total their rows in the browser. That
would double the definition of every figure — the report's and the chart's — and
they drift. Worse, the definitions that matter here are exactly the subtle ones:
stock is only stock if a posted GRN put it there (`integrity`), and a purchase
counts on its invoice date rather than the day it was keyed. Both live in Python
already, so the charts are computed next to them.

CONSISTENCY WITH THE TILES
--------------------------
`stock_by_category` filters products through `integrity.Context` — the same rule
`inventory_summary` uses for the Stock value tile. Without that the donut would
total a different, larger number than the tile directly above it, and the honest
reading of that is that one of them is wrong.

WHAT IS NOT HERE
----------------
No sales series. This system records purchases in and dispatches out; it has no
customer, price or sale. "Stock outward" is goods leaving for a shop or another
godown, which is a transfer, not a sale — charting it as revenue would invent a
figure the database does not contain.
