"""The notification centre: every queue in the warehouse, as one list.

The dashboard already answers "what is waiting on someone", but only for whoever
opens the dashboard. This is the same question asked the other way round — the
list comes to you, it says how long each thing has been waiting, and it
remembers what you have already seen.

**Notices are derived, not logged.** Almost nothing here is an event; it is a
condition — four GRNs in draft, eleven lines dead for six months. Filing an
event every time a check ran would refile the same four drafts hourly. So each
rule reads the current state and returns one notice or nothing, and the only
thing stored is the acknowledgement (models.NotificationState).

**Read means read at a number.** Acknowledging "4 drafts" stores 4. At five it
is unread again, because a fifth is news; at three it stays quiet, because a
queue that shrank needs nobody chased. This is what makes a bell that can be
cleared and still be trusted.

**A clear queue produces no notice at all.** A centre that lists "0 invoices to
review" trains people to skim past it, and then they skim past the one that says
eleven.
