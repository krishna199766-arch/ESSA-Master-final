"""
Inventory integrity — what is allowed to be counted, shown and printed.

Stock is only ever created by posting a GRN. So every inventory record should be
traceable back to a posted GRN, and anything that isn't is not stock — it is
debris, and the danger is that it does not *look* like debris. A stale piece code
carries a real-looking QR, prints on a real label and scans to a real product. The
warehouse has no way to tell it from a live one.

That is not hypothetical. A bulk `clear-all` once emptied `products` without
touching `product_units` or `bundles`; ids then restarted, and the next product to
land on id 1 silently adopted a hundred dead piece codes belonging to a product
that no longer existed. The screen read "110 pieces of 10 Pcs in stock" and offered
to print all 110. Nothing was corrupt at the row level — every row was individually
valid — which is exactly why nothing caught it. `clear-all` now deletes those
children explicitly; this module is the standing check that does not depend on
every future delete path remembering to.

THREE STATES, and only the first is stock
-----------------------------------------
* **posted** — traceable to a GRN that is posted. Real stock.
* **unposted** — traceable to a GRN that exists but has been unposted. Its stock
  was reversed, so it is already zero; the record is kept deliberately (see
  `inventory.unpost_grn`) because it carries history the GRN never created —
  phone-recorded detailing, a dispatch, a return. Excluded from stock and from
  labels; **never** deleted, because deleting it would destroy that history.
* **orphan** — traceable to nothing at all: no purchase line, no breakdown row, no
  stock movement. Nothing that could have created it survives. This is debris,
  and it is what `repair()` removes.

The distinction between the last two is the whole reason repair is not simply
"delete anything without a posted GRN". Both are excluded from stock; only one is
safe to delete.

The middle state applies to **products only**. A piece code or a carton label has
no history of its own — it is a pointer to a garment or a box that a receipt put
somewhere — so if its GRN is not posted there is nothing for it to point at, and
`unpost_grn` already deletes both on that reasoning. One still naming an unposted
GRN is a row that escaped a cleanup, not a record worth preserving.

WHAT COUNTS AS "the right number of pieces"
-------------------------------------------
Two different questions, deliberately answered against two different figures:

* **Integrity** compares live piece codes against the quantity this SKU has
  actually *received* from GRNs (`expected_units`). Piece codes are minted at
  receipt and nothing consumes them yet — dispatching by unit is a later step — so
  a garment that has been sent out still has its identity. Comparing against
  current stock would flag every dispatch as corruption.
* **Printing** compares them against **stock on hand**, because that is the
  physical question: you cannot tag garments you do not have. Ten in stock and a
  hundred codes is the failure this module exists for; ten codes and seven in
  stock means three have already gone out wearing their labels.
