"""Physical Stock Audit — counting a warehouse by quantity, and correcting it.

    pick what to count → open → count / scan / upload → complete
      → review → approve → apply

THE SHAPE OF THE DOCUMENT, and why it is not the other audit. `stock_audit.py`
beside this one asks *is this item on the shelf*: one row per tag read, a
presence check for somebody walking a rack with a phone. This asks *how many are
there*, which needs a different document — opened over a defined SET of stock,
with a line per item whether or not anybody has been to look at it yet, and a
variance that is the whole output. Neither question can be asked of the other's
record, so there are two.

WHAT THE FILTERS ARE FOR, AND WHY THEY ARE SAVED. Nobody counts a warehouse.
They count the MENS rack, or everything of one brand, or one supplier's goods —
and the set they walked is part of what the count means. A count of "BRAND=YUVA"
that later read as a count of the building would report every other rack as
missing stock. So `scope` is snapshotted onto the header at open, and the
variance is only ever measured against the lines inside it.

**A COUNT IS NOT AN ADJUSTMENT.** Counting writes nothing to the ledger.
`apply()` is a separate, approved act that writes real StockMovement rows through
`stock_locations.apply` — the one door stock moves through in this app — each
carrying the audit's number and its change reason. This is the same rule
`AuditSession` keeps; the difference is that this module gives it a way through
rather than leaving the correction to be retyped somewhere else.

THREE KINDS OF LINE ARE LEFT ALONE BY `apply`, and each for its own reason:

  * **Uncounted** — nobody looked. Not a finding, and adjusting on it would turn
    an unfinished count into a warehouse-wide write-off.
  * **Issued mid-count** ("Remove Sales") — stock legitimately left the building
    between the figure being frozen and the shelf being walked, so the gap is the
    dispatch, not a loss. Held out and flagged rather than silently absorbed.
  * **No product** — an uploaded or scanned code that matches nothing. That is a
    master-data problem and there is no balance to correct.

Each is reported back by `apply`, so the screen can say what it did *not* do.
