"""Dead stock detection, the discount ladder, and what clearing it is worth.

The question this answers is "what have we been holding that nobody is buying,
and what is it worth to move it out". It is a READ over the records that already
exist — products, the stock-movement ledger, and the till's sales — and it
creates no stock of its own. A clearance line points at the product it came
from; when that product sells at the counter, the campaign's realisation moves
because the sale moved, not because anyone re-keyed it here.

**What counts as movement.** A garment is alive if it has left the warehouse in
either of the two ways stock leaves: sold at the till (services/pos_sales.py) or
dispatched to a store on a Stock Outward. The later of those two dates is what
the age is measured from — an item dispatched last week is not dead stock
whatever the till has done, and vice versa.

**Stock that has never moved at all.** Most of the register is this, and it is
the case the Excel had no answer for: with no sale to date from, "days since
sale" is blank and the row disappears out of the report that exists to find it.
Here the clock runs from the day the stock last CAME IN, and the row says so
(`basis`). Last inward rather than first: a SKU that was restocked a fortnight
ago is being bought, and dating it from a receipt two years old would fill the
register with lines nobody needs to act on — which is how a report like this
stops being read.

**Purchase returns are not movement.** Goods sent back to a supplier leave the
building without anybody buying them; counting that as life would hide a line
that was rejected precisely because it wasn't selling.
