"""Changing what things sell for — one item, or a whole category at once.

    pick the products → choose what to do to them → SEE IT FIRST → apply

The preview is not a courtesy. A bulk price change is the easiest way in this
whole application to do a great deal of damage very quickly: "20% off" applied
to the wrong filter reprices ten thousand garments, and the only thing standing
between that and a shop selling stock below cost is somebody being shown the
before and after while they can still say no. So `preview` and `apply` run the
SAME calculation over the SAME selection, and the screen shows what apply will
do rather than a description of it.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT A PRICE HERE.

    mrp                the printed maximum. What the label says.
    sale_price         what the shop actually charges. What the till bills.
    sale_discount_pct  the lever between them, in percent.

    avg_cost           NOT changeable. It is what the goods cost, worked out by
                       weighted average from the GRNs that brought them in. Every
                       margin and every valuation in the app reads it, and typing
                       over it would turn arithmetic into an opinion.

TWO THINGS ARE REFUSED AND ONE IS WARNED ABOUT. A negative price is refused —
there is no such thing. A revert that would discard a later change is refused,
because putting back last month's price after somebody repriced yesterday would
silently undo their work. Selling ABOVE MRP is only warned about: it is illegal
to do, but MRP is blank on plenty of items and refusing would block honest
repricing on all of them. The warning names the products.
